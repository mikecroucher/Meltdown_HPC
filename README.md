# Melthdown and High Performance Computing

## Authors:

Collaborative blog post about the effect of meltdown on HPC systems. 

Once we've finished this, we can reblog where-ever we like.

# Introduction

The [Meltdown bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)) which affects most modern CPUs has been called by some ['The worst ever CPU bug'](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/04/meltdown-spectre-worst-cpu-bugs-ever-found-affect-computers-intel-processors-security-flaw).  Accessible explanations about what the Meltdown bug actually is are available [here](https://www.facebook.com/Ozzard/posts/10157151940878975) and [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/why-raspberry-pi-isnt-vulnerable-to-spectre-or-meltdown/).

Software patches have been made available but some people have esitmated a performance hit of up to 30% in some cases. Some of us in the High Performance Computing (HPC) (See [here for the initial twitter conversation](https://twitter.com/walkingrandomly/status/949230133243768835)) community started to wonder what this might mean for the type of workloads run on our systems.  After all, if the worst case scenario of 30% is the norm, it will drastically affect the power of our systems and hence reduce the amount of science we are able to support.
